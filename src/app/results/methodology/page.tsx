            <p>
              No single model tells the whole truth. We triangulate across three
              lenses and reconcile the differences rather than trusting any one in
              isolation.

                Platform-reported attribution
              </span>{' '}
              (Meta, Google, and similar) is fast and granular, but it tends to
              over-claim because each platform credits conversions to itself
              within its own window. We use it for in-flight optimization, not as
              the final word on contribution.

              </span>{' '}
              distributes credit across the touchpoints in a customer journey. It
              gives a more balanced cross-channel view than last-click, but it is
              still a modeling choice and depends on the quality of the underlying
              tracking.

              </span>{' '}
              answers the question the others cannot: what would have happened
              anyway. Where the stakes and budget justify it, incrementality
              testing is the standard we anchor to, because it measures the lift a
              channel actually caused rather than the conversions it merely
              touched.

            <p>
              Incrementality testing is how we separate marketing that caused a
              result from marketing that simply rode alongside one. The common
              methods we use, matched to budget and risk, include:

          <Section eyebrow="Windows" title="Time Windows & Reporting Periods">
            <p>
              Attribution windows materially change a number, so we state them.
              Click and view windows are agreed at the start of an engagement and
              held constant for the duration, which is what makes period-over-period
              comparison meaningful.
            </p>
            <p>
              For results that compound, we report a clearly labeled before period
              and after period rather than cherry-picking a single peak month.
              Seasonality and promotional spikes are called out where they
              materially affect a result.

          <Section eyebrow="Honesty" title="Caveats & Limitations">
            <p>
              Measurement is a discipline of approximation, not certainty. We think
              naming the limits is part of doing it well.
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-3 list-none">
              <li className="flex gap-3">

                <span>
                  Signal loss from privacy changes, cookie deprecation, and
                  consent gating means tracked conversions undercount reality, and
                  modeled conversions fill the gap imperfectly.

                <span>
                  Attribution assigns credit; it does not prove causation. Only
                  controlled tests get close, and even those carry confidence
                  intervals.

                <span>
                  External factors (brand momentum, pricing, PR, market shifts)
                  influence results and cannot always be isolated from marketing
                  effect.

                  Case-study figures reflect a specific brand, period, and context.
                  They are evidence of what is possible, not a guarantee of what any
                  other brand will achieve.

              not the most impressive number, it is the most defensible one.
